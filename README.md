# Capstone-Projec
My Capstone Project was to create a Visitors registration system for the Conestoga College Research Center and where will visitors will be able to select employees to visit and sign in and a barcode will be generated and also sign out of the system using the generated barcode. I and my team mate develop this using Universal Windows platform and Ms sql and we also created and admin panel and connected both via web server.
I design the front end and database and also helped in the UML design
